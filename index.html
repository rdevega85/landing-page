<section id="section-b">

  Have you ever thought to yourself, "what is my purpose?" Like most people it took some time to find a path as there were so many options along the way. Not having answers to my own questions is the toughest feeling. So, what do I do? I go for my passion, I put myself in position to do something creative as a profession. As of now I am a freelance Web Developer. Since I went on this path I have never been happier. Learning languages to create beautiful responsive websites has been quite a journey and cant wait to working with clients for future projects.
